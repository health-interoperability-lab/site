<p>As someone who is working to establish an independent research lab, I can attest that resources such as these are most welcome. It’s a shame for individuals who make enormous contributions to their fields to not be able to highlight and share those achievements due to a lack of technological expertise. I have seen many lab sites that are woefully outdated and difficult to navigate–all belonging to individuals who are titans in their chosen domains.</p>

<p>What a valuable contribution from the Greene Lab!</p>]]></content><author><name>michael-watkins</name></author><category term="academic-lab," /><category term="website" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a great experience using the Lab Website Template from the Greene Lab.
