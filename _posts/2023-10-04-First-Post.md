I had a great experience using the [Lab Website Template](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/introduction/overview) from the [Greene Lab](https://greenelab.com/). Very careful and thorough documentation. I had debated on whether or not to create [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) site but ultimately decided that the citation functionality in this template will be well worth the dependence on an external group.
