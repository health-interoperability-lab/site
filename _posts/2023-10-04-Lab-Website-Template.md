I had a great experience using the [Lab Website Template](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/introduction/overview) from the [Greene Lab](https://greenelab.com/). Very careful and thorough documentation. I had debated on whether or not to create a [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) site but ultimately decided that the citation functionality in this template will be well worth the dependence on an external group. 

As someone who is working to establish an independent research lab, I can attest that resources such as these are most welcome. It's a shame for individuals who make enormous contributions to their fields to not be able to highlight and share those achievements due to a lack of technological expertise. I have seen many lab sites that are woefully outdated and difficult to navigate--all belonging to individuals who are titans in their chosen domains.

What a valuable contribution from the Greene Lab!
